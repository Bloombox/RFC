# OpenCannabis  [![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL%20v3-blue.svg?longCache=true&style=flat-square)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0)

_OpenCannabis_ is a multilateral industrial effort to create an interoperable technical data specification tailored for
the **worldwide legal cannabis market**.

As legal markets to buy, sell, cultivate and manufacture cannabis products come online, a need is emerging for a
universal way of connecting data systems and components that work with cannabis or cannabis-related data.

### On the shoulders of giants

The OpenCannabis Specification and related materials are written with modern, cutting-edge tools. The project structure
is inspired by [Unprotocols RFC](https://github.com/unprotocols/rfc), which is a repository for universal, cross-project
protocols used in software development, ranging from workflow to technical.

The specification is codified in a series of documents - referred to as the "*Specification*," or "*Spec*," and a
software implementation, referred to as the "*Protocol*," which is written in
[Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/), a language from Google. Other specifications
written in industrial circumstances have seen success with this exact model (see:
[OpenRTB](https://openrtb.github.io/OpenRTB/)).

### Authors and backers

OpenCannabis was conceived at [Bloombox](https://bloombox.io), but it's open and free to the world (under the GNU GPLv3
license). Early adopters and collaborators include [Caliva](https://caliva.menu) and
[Abatin Sacramento](https://abatinsacramento.com).
